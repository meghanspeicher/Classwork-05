		<figcaption> Every year my family and I go to the Jersey shore for a week. While we are there we go to the beach, the boardwalk, and go to get Springer's ice cream in Stone Harbor. A couple of my favorite things to do at the beach are parasail, jet ski, tan, and shop. </figcaption>

		<figcaption> My favorite place to get ice cream is Woodside Creamery. My favorite flavor is either black raspberry or vanilla. This summer I want to get a job there. My favorite topping on ice cream is sprinkles. </figcaption>
